AI Disclosure: 
I first started writing my code on Jupyter Notebooks, where I developed the logic. Gemini (AI) was used to help fix bugs in the code and to help with the data merging and cleaning. Once the code was running smoothly in notebooks, I used Gemini (AI) to transfer my initial Jupyter Notebook analysis into a modular Python package (copy pasting from the notebook cells was not working due to come lines of code repeating themselves, so AI was used as a assistant).


Refactoring: 
In detailed terms, AI assisted me in separating data loading, modeling, and evaluation logic into discrete .py files to closely follow the structure required for this project.


Git Troubleshooting:
Laslty, AI helped me resolve authentication issues related to Personal Access Tokens (PAT) and remote URL configurations as well as other complications I ran into regarding GitHub.
